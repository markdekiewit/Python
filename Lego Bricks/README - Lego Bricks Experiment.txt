HI

The idea behind this little experiment is to fold:
1) the intial idea was to convert an pixels in an image to the primary colours red, green, blue by determining to which the pixel is closest

2) the second thought was then to compare the processing time between a for-loop based code and a numpy matrix based code.

It was interesting to see that the numpy matrix based version runs approx 5 times faster then the for-loop based version.
Expected of course, but fun nevertheless!

This little project is work in progress and may be extended to:
1) including a variable number of colours
2) trying to determe the minimum number of lego brick to buy
